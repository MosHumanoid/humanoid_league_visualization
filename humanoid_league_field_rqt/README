This package provides a rqt plugin which can display positions on a 2D RoboCup soccer field.
It uses the messages defined in humanoid_league_msgs.
For the moment only the position of the robot is implemented, but it is easy to add other objects to it.

For using it, compile and source the plugin. Afterwards it should be accesible in rqt.
